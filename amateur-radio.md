## Interest Group Meetings

Starting in Spring 2022, we will have meetings at 1:30pm in **Bell Tower Eat 2810**, the Mathematics Department conference room.

Meetings will be informal.  We will use the time to talk about what we can do with amateur radio at CI, how individuals can earn a license to become an amateur radio operator, and other topics related to amateur radio.

Once we have an idea of what the group of interested people want to do, we will identify meeting topics in advance and announcement them to the `amateur-radio` email list.
