## Interest Group Meetings

The campus amateur radio clubs will meet **at noon on the first Tuesday of every month**.  Locations tBA, but when in doubt, show up at the Radio Room (Del Norte 3512).  

Watch for additional meetings on Tuesdays at noon or in the radio room.

## Radio Room

Our Radio Room in Del Norte 3512 is alive and kicking.  We have fice transcievers (three dual band UHF/VHF, one HF/UHF/VHF, all Yaesu made; and we have one 220MHz transceiver).  We have six runs of LMR-400 between the room and the roof along with two runs of CAT6 cable.  On the roof, we have five Comet CX-333 antennas and one wire loop antenna for 40m.  

We also have three GOTA boxes with a power supply, a Yaesu 991, and a Yaesu FT500DM.  The GOTA box also has antennas - a buddipole and a CS-333 with tripod and mast.

The radio room also has a few PCs with radio-related software installed (along with the standard campus software suite) ready to be used creatively.

All this is here and it wants to be used by members of this interest group.  To be a member of this group, you need to be part of the University community (employee or student).  To be given independent access to the room (_i.e._, keycode access), you need to be a member with an amateur radio license.  You will also need to sign an agreement that outlines how the room should be used, etc.

If you have keycode access, please *remember* to sign in on the clipboard so we have a record of who is using the room, when it's being used, and for what.  This record is important because it gives us data that shows the room is a campus asset.

Note that it's OK to use the room to do homework or hangout between classes to listen to the dual band on scan.  Even that use should get recorded on the clipboard.  But please give priority to those folks who want to use the space for doing radio-related work.
