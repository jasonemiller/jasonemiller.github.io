## Club Meetings

Meetings for Spring 2025 are at noon on the first and third Thursdays of the month, except where noted (e.g., Spring Break), in Del Norte 3550:

<dl>
<dt><b>6 Feb:</b></dt>
<dd>Prof. Ben Kuo will present on 'Come Learn How Radio Can Save Your Life.'</dd>

<dt><b>20 Feb:</b></dt>
<dd>Prof. Miller will tell you how to prepare for, take, and pass the Technician's licensing exam.  He'll also talk about types of radios available to folks like us.</dd>

<dt><b>6 Mar:</b></dt>
<dd>``How to talk on the radio.'' We'll have an hands-on activity that will show everyone how to use a hand-held amateur radio.  If you have a hand-held of your own, bring it to the meeting.  (Consider bringing its manual, too, if you can put your hands on it.)  If you don't have your own radio, the club can lend you one to use for the activities.  No amateur radio license is required for these activities.  We'll talk about the parts of a hand-held radio, how to change its frequency, setting squelch, how to send a message, and how you should hold the radio when you talk into it.  Then we'll practice what we learned by simulating what is called a radio net (or network) that is moderated by a net controller.  It's gonna be great.</dd>

<dt><b>20 Mar:</b></dt>
<dd>``Practice Fox Hunt.''  The club has acquired small battery powered transmitters called 'foxes' that are used in a radio-based game called a 'fox hunt'.  We are going to practice a fox hunt with simple handheld radios in the north quad.  Come join us.
</dd>

<dt><b>17 April:</b></dt>
<dd>``Club Business and Exam Prep.''  We will talk about officers for the Fall semester and the 2025-2026 school year, and we'll talk about a Fox hunt event with the Veteran's Club.  There will also be talk about a club t-shirt.  Time permitting, we'll review some tesst taking strategies for taking an amateur radio licensing exam.  The club is trying to secure May 4th as a date to give the exam on campus.
</dd>

<dt><b>1 May:</b></dt>
<dd>Topic is to be determined.  If you have ideas or requests, email <a href="mailto:neysi.reyes662@myci.csuci.edu">Neysi</a>, the club president.</dd>
</dl>

## Other Meetings

Officers of the student club plan to meet at noon on the Tuesdays before a club meeting.  They will generally convene at the Radio Room.

We also hope to schedule some Get On The Air activities outside where we set up radios, batteries, and antennas for all to see.  If you want to be involved in that, email <a href="mailto:neysi.reyes662@myci.csuci.edu">Neysi</a>, the club president.


## Radio Room

Our Radio Room in Del Norte 3512 is alive and kicking.  We have five transcievers (three dual band UHF/VHF, one HF/UHF/VHF, all Yaesu made; and we have one 220MHz transceiver that isn't connected yet).  We have six runs of LMR-400 between the room and the roof along with two runs of CAT6 cable.  On the roof, we have five Comet CX-333 antennas and one wire loop antenna for 40m.  

We also have a GOTA box with a power supply, a Yaesu 991, and a Yaesu FT500DM.  The GOTA box also has antennas - a buddipole and a CS-333 with tripod and mast.

The radio room also has a few PCs with radio-related software installed (along with the standard campus software suite) ready to be used creatively.

All this is here and it wants to be used by members of this interest group.  To be a member of this group, you need to be part of the University community (employee or student).  To be given independent access to the room (_i.e._, keycode access), you need to be a member with an amateur radio license.  You will also need to sign an agreement that outlines how the room should be used, etc.

If you have keycode access, please *remember* to sign in on the clipboard so we have a record of who is using the room, when it's being used, and for what.  This record is important because it gives us data that shows the room is a campus asset.

Note that it's OK to use the room to do homework or hangout between classes to listen to the dual band on scan.  Even that use should get recorded on the clipboard.  But please give priority to those folks who want to use the space for doing radio-related work.
