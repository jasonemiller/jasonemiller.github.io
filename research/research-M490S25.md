## Amateur Radio and Sensor Data ##

This page supports the research projects I am offering students through an Independent Research course (MATH 490) in Spring 2026.

An enrolled CI student can take this course for a variable amount of credits (1-3) and the course expectations will reflect their choice.  

Participation is limited to students who are eligible to earn an amateur radio license from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).  Those requirements include having a U.S. taxpayer ID nummber (i.e., TIN or SSN), a U.S. postal address, and an email address.  Eligibility of individuals with a felony criminal record are determined on a case-by-case basis.

All project will likely require a student to have access to a computer which allows them to install specialized software.  If a student does not have a personal computer to use, they should check one out from the library for use all semester.

All software employed in the project will either be free and open source.  If we use any licensed software, we will strictly follow all terms and conditions of licenses we purchase.

### Objective ###

Convey sensor data via transceivers on mobile or statics platforms to be recorded on a base station (perhaps through a mesh nework) for analysis.

### Expectations and Outcomes ###

The team will meet with Dr. Miller weekly, with 50 minutes per MATH 490 credit hour the average time per week.  Outside of team meeting, research students will be expected to work 3 hours per week per credit hour on the project.

All students will be expected to do the following:

* earn/upgrade amateur radio license to general
* public presentation (formal) on project, project goals, preliminary results (campus Student Research Conference, CSU Research Competition, SCCUR Fqll 2026, MicroExpo Fall 2026, or other venue)
* detailed written project report for final exam
* keep work log for work on project to record ideas, tasks completed, challenges, etc.  The log is property of Dr. Miller at end of the course
* attends project meetings and large group meetings
* completes work in a timely manner
* understands risks and responsibilities associated with project

In addition, depending on the number of credits taken, students will choose two or more of the following project tasks to support and complete before the end of the semester:

* learn to set-up a LoRa transceiver to send and receive sensor data and to record data on a micro SD card
* learn to set up a WSPR net transceiver to send and receive sensor data and to record data on a micro SD card
* build fly, and track a traquito-based pico balloon powered by solar panels
* build, fly, track, and retrieve model rocket with sensor package and radio beacon
* build, fly, and track small UAV with sensor package
* create a dashboard to display current and past balloon flight data
learn to use WSPR-X protocols, radiosonde to support project goals (or find more appropriate substitutes)

Some of these efforts will require students to be able to travel to off-campus locations and do outdoor work requiring moderate effort.

### Activities ###

To realize the goals and outcomes listed about, students will engage in the following types of activities.  Most activities will be available to all students, though some activities will have more limited participation.

* study and pass licensing exams for the technicial and general class amateur radio licenses
* practice fox hunting with radio, with directional antenna
* build and test accelerometer for rocket, balloon, UAV payload
* practice finding small rocket with radio transmitter (non-GPS)
* practice finding small rocket with APRS transmitter (GPS) using directional antenna and using GPS app (e.g., aprs.fi)
* practice actively tracking rocket/balloon/UAV with directional antenna(s) affixed with accelerometer to determine direction of antenna (with multiple antennas, can triangulate location of rocket, incl altitude - good practice working with data); compare with data from accelerometer on rocket
* build radio transmitter for rocket
* build APRS transmitter (with GPS) for rocket
* construct traquito payload gear for balloon
* practice tracking transmitters using WPSR net, WSPR-X, and radiosonde; display data on dashboard
* build ground station to collect/forward WSPR/APRS data on HF/VHF frequencies 
* construct display at radio room

In addition, all students will participate in weekly team meetings where project participants will update one another, share successes and challenges, and share objectives for the coming week.  Occasionally, students will share with others written drafts of written reports on their project; feedback they receive will improve their final research report.
