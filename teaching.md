## Past Teaching ##

The courses I have taught are organized by mathematics courses (upper- and lower-level) and non-mathematics courses. &nbsp;Those courses marked with a &#8216;*&#8217; were developed by me.

### Lower-level Mathematics courses ###

* _Freshman Seminar_: A transition course for first-time, first-year students who are interested in pursuing the mathematics major. (Truman State University)

* _Plane Trigonometry_: A course in plane trigonometry and function theory (pre-calculus) to prepare students for calculus and college-level mathematics. (Truman State University, University of North Carolina)

* _Elementary Functions_ : A pre-calculus course covering college algebra and plane trigonometry, preparing students for calculus and college-level mathematics. (Truman State University, University of North Carolina)

* _Basic Statistics_ : A first course in statistics for students who have completed pre-calculus. Covers descriptive statistics, probability, and hypothesis testing. (Truman State University)

* _Liberal Arts & Sciences Calculus_ : A course in the ideas of the Calculus, for students who are not pursuing a STEM degree. Topics included differentiation and tangent lines, ordinary differential equations and systems of ODEs, and integration. (Truman State University)

* _Calculus & Analytic Geometry I_ : A first course in the Calculus, covering differentiation and integration. Used Mathematica. (Truman State University, 5 credits; University of North Carolina, 3 credits)

* _Calculus & Analytic Geometry II_ : A second course in the Calculus, covering advanced techniques in integration, sequences and series, and three-dimensional analytic geometry. (Truman State University, 5 credits)

* _Calculus II_ : A second course in the Calculus, covering advanced techniques in integration, and sequences and series. (CSU Channel Islands, 4 credits)

* _Calculus for Life Science_ : A one-semester course covering mathematics of immediate use to biology majors. Topics included differential and integral calculus, ordinary differential equations, graph theory, matrix theory. Used Matlab. Developed with grant funding, <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=0926737&amp;HistoricalAwards=false">NSF-DMS 0926737</a>. (Truman State University)


### Upper-level Mathematics courses ###

* _Linear Algebra_ : A course in the theory of matrices and linear transformations. Covers vector spaces, transformations, change of basis, and diagonalization. (Truman State University)

* _Ordinary Differential Equations_ : A first course in ordinary differential equations, their solutions, numerical techniques, and their use in mathematical modeling. (Truman State University)

* _Discrete Mathematics_ : (Truman State University)

* _Algebraic Structure_ : A first course in abstract algebra for the mathematics major. (Truman State University)

* _Advanced Calculus I_ : A first course in real analysis for the mathematics majors. (Truman State University)

* _Advanced Calculus II_ : A second course in real analysis for the mathematics majors. (Truman State University)

* _Topics in Mathematical Modeling_ : A course in the creations, use, and assessment of mathematical models. (Truman State University)

* _Differential Geometry_ : A course in survey and surfaces that introduces students to the theory of manifold.

* _Capstone Seminar_ : A seminar that assists senior mathematics majors in the completion of their Senior Capstone Integration Experience. (Truman State University)

* _Senior Seminar_ : A seminar that assists senior mathematics majors in their transition from college to a post-college experience such as a career or graduate school. (Truman State University)

* _Undergraduate Readings in Mathematics_ : Independent study on a topic in mathematics that merits deep study. Topics pursues include tilings of the plane, game theory, machine learning, and image analysis. (Truman State University)

* _Undergraduate Research)_ : Faculty mentored research with an undergraduate student. (Truman State University)

### Non-Mathematics Courses ###

* _Conflict, Cooperation, and Choice_ : A junior interdisciplinary seminar on the topic of rationality, using game theory and economics as paradigms for understanding why we assume humans are rational and what can go wrong when we do. Writing Enhanced. (Truman State University)
* _STEM Seminar_ : An interdisciplinary transition course for first-time, first-year students who are interested in pursuing a STEM major. Developed with grant funding, <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=0928013&amp;HistoricalAwards=false">NSF-DMS 0928013</a>. (Truman State University)
* _Inquiry Seminar_ : An interdisciplinary seminar for early-career STEM first-year students who want to pursue undergraduate research. Developed with grant funding, <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=0928013&amp;HistoricalAwards=false">NSF-DMS 0928013</a>. (Truman State University)
* _Grant Writing_ : &nbsp;An upper-level elective for the Technical Writing emphasis in the English major. &nbsp;The course covers the grant economy, looking for grants, creating a grant proposal, creating a grant budget, and basic financial compliance issues. &nbsp;(CSU Channel Islands)
* _Presenting Your Research_  (UNIV 311)*: a course for students who are conducting independent research with a faculty mentor; all disciplines are welcome. All students are required to attend the SAGE Student Research Conference, or similar conference, to present a talk or poster. The course is excellent preparation for the CSU Research Competition. &nbsp;(CSU Channel Islands)



### Course Development and Co-Curricular Experiences ###

I've lead or supported the development of several courses. Some were grant-funded efforts, others were in service to my department. These courses are listed here.


* _Conflict, Cooperation, and Choice_ : A junior interdisciplinary seminar on the topic of rationality, using game theory and economics as paradigms for understanding why we assume humans are rational and what can go wrong when we do. Writing Enhanced. (Truman State University)
* _SMaCS Seminar_ : A monthly evening meeting for students involved in the NSF-funded Scholars in Mathematics and Computer Science program, &nbsp;The meetings built community, provided professional development experiences, and supported excellent students pursuing a degree in mathematics or computer science. &nbsp;Developed with grant funding, <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=0123094&amp;HistoricalAwards=false">NSF-DUE 0123094</a>.
