This page describes some of my past and current research interests.  Much of my work after my Ph.D. arose from interdisciplinary collaborations with life scientists and in service of undergraduates seeking high quality, faculty mentored research experiences.

## Current Research ##

Research topics currently of interest to me are:

* Relative Critical Sets in R<sup>n</sup>
* Inferring geometric structures of functions from their ridge-valley-connector set
* Whitney stratification of the space of real symmetric matrices
* Using characteristics of their search-phase echolocation call to automatically identify free-flying bats to species

These topics may lend themselves for excellent undergraduate research projects or master theses.  Please talk with me if you are interested.

I am open to other collaborations in the mathematical sciences or with faculty from other disciplines.

## Past Research ##

Below is a list of past research topics.  I will try to link them to rich descriptions of the topic and of the work.

* Describing the shape of human nasal passages using the Blum Medial Axis
* Describing leaf morphology using the Blum Medial Axis
* Promoting success in STEM through early-career student research projects
* Mentoring undergraduates in research at the intersection of the life and mathematical sciences
* Successful practices in STEM transfer from 2-year to 4-year colleges
