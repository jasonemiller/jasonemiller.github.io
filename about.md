Jason Miller, Ph.D., is a mathematician on the faculty of [California State University](http://www.calstate.edu) [Channel Islands](http://www.csuci.edu).  THe CSU is the largest University system in the United States and prepares more individuals to be contibuting residents and citizens of the U.S. than any other.  We are a testing ground for innovation and education for the 21st century.

Miller has been a higher education professional since 1998 when he earned his doctorate from UNC Chapel Hill and took a tenure-track position at [Truman State University](http://www.truman.edu), the best medium-sized public liberal arts University in the Midwest.  Prior to graduate school, he'd earned a B.A. in Mathematics from [St. Olaf College](http://www.stolaf.edu), the largest producer of mathematics majors in America.  Olaf's big tent mentality toward mathematics shaped the way Miller view mathematics and STEM education.

At Truman State University, Miller helped lead several innovative programs that broadened participation in STEM.  These included 

* the undergraduate Scholars in Mathematics and Computer Science (SMaCS) program (supported by NSF-CSEMS and NSF-SSTEM grants),
* the Mathematical Biology Initiative (supported by NSF-UBM grants), and
* the SPECTRA Program (suypported by NSF-PRISM grant).

His work on these grants led to numerous invitations to present at professional STEM conferences and to contribute to national conversations on STEM education in the 21st century.  He counts his work on NSF proposal review panels among his most rewarding professional service.

Through the mathematics department's Capstone research requirement (for all majors), and through the external grant funding provided from the NSF, Miller has mentored scores of undergraduates in research in mathematics and in mathematical biology.  He served on the Board for the [National Conference for Undergraduate Research](http://www.ncur.org) (NCUR) before serving as its Chair and ushering in its merger with the [Council on Undergraduate Research](http://www.cur.org).

In 2013, Miller accepted the invitation to be the first Senior Research Officer at CSU Channel Islands, the nation's second newest University campuses.  For four and a half years, he helped strengthen the research, scholarship, and creative activities (RSCA) of faculty and students.  He supported the growth of work in Unpiloted Aerial Vehicles, and he strengthened connections with Naval Base Ventural County and its three naval Labs.  In 2018, after consistenly growing sponsored research, he felt he'd done all he could for RSCA at the University and decided to return to the faculty.

He continues to support undergraduate research and other ways to promote equity and inclusion in higher education.  For example (and thanks to Project PROMESAS), he used mastery-based grading to transformed the way he teached Calculus.  He also continues to support faculty through leadership in shared governance by being elected to the position of Vice Chair of Academic Senate in 2019.

Miller is committed to strengthening the mathematics program, its majors, minors, and Master degrees.  He is committed to broadening participation in mathematics and STEM, and hopes to ignite a local mathematical biology community.
