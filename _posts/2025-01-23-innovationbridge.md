In December, President Yao approved the creation of the **Innovation Bridge**, a new applied research institute at the University.  The Innovation Bridge is a faculty-led effort designed to foster sustainable and robust collaboration between the University and Navy commands at Naval Base Ventura County (NBVC).  Acting as a portal, The Innovation Bridge will facilitate and catalyze partnerships, providing a structured pathway for engagement.  

During our first year, we will focus on a few specific efforts that include

* promoting academic engagement with Fathomwerx programming such as [Coastal Trident](https://antx.org/coastal-trident/), the [Fathomwerx Summit](https://www.fathomwerx.com/fathomwerx-summit), and [Project R](https://www.diu.mil/replicator),

* facilitating participation in command-specific programming such as the [Navy Summer Faculty Research  and Sabbatical Leave Program](http://onroutreach-summer-faculty-research-sabbatical.com) and summer student [internships](https://www.navalsteminterns.us/nreip/), and 

* creating opportunities for academia to interact with Navy engineers through Fathomwerx programming.

The Innovation Bridge will work to expand Fathomwerx programming beyond just Cal State Channel Islands to all regional Universities in San Luis Obispo County, Santa Barbara County, Ventura County, and Kern County.

At another level, the Innovation Bridge will support economic development activity in the region by leveraging our knowledge of unique regional assets (including Naval assets) that enhance the region's competitiveness for industry and that boost the region's ability to prepare the its workforce to meet industry needs.  Our work in this area will include

* inviting regional professional organizations to schedule member meetings on the University campus, 

* supporting efforts to attract autonomous air mobility companies to the region, 

* convening stakeholder conversations about industry challenges and how we can leverage loccal talent and creativity to solve them, and

* working with industry and education providers to identify and support upskilling programs for students and members of our workforce.

Work of the Innovation Bridge has begun, and we expect a public launch of the Innovation Bridge at the Fathomwerx Summit on October 15th, 2025.
