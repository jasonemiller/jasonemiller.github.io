Amateur radio is one step closer to having a place to live and work on campus.  Yesterday, Bill Boyd from the Ventura County Sheriff Department's Office of Emergency Management came to campus with Stu Sheldon, a representative of the volunteer Auxilliary Communication Service (ACS), to check out Bell Tower 2301.  This small closet between Bell Tower and Bell Tower West has been identified as a potential home for a radio room on campus.

The radio room would be home to communications gear that could be operated by people who had an amateur radio license, or anyone under the supervision of a person with a license.  Students could use the gear to learn how to be on air and talk with other folks in the area or beyond.  This skill doesn't seem notable until you try it and you start to explore what it means to be able to communicate with this kind of radio.

Most people have the experience of listening to news or music on a radio in the car or at home.  In that situation, you are a consumer of radio.  When you have an amateur radio license, you find youself on the other end of that production-consumption process.  You are putting things out onto the airwaves for everyone to hear.  It's like using a walkie-talkie but with the expectation that you're on a stage and anyone could hear what you're saying.

This exposure leads to 'mike fright', a nervousness about speaking into a broadcasting microphone.  Most people experience it, and it's overcome through practice and experience.  The more you talk on the radio, the more confident you become about talking on the radio.

One barrier to broadcasting confidence is the type of banter radio operators use.  'Roger' and 'five by five' and 'QT' are just three of the jargon phrases  radio operators use that are inscruitable to non-operators.  Learning the meaning of jargon and how to use it comes with experience.  Operators are understanding of new amateurs as they learn the langauge and the cadence of talking on the air, and they won't talk about it much, but there is a create variety in the styles and patterns of speaking on air.  The vocabulary and patterns of speech are artifacts of history and from lessons in the efficient and clear use of radio.  A new operator shouldn't get too anxious about it all.  Just dive in, listen, and emulate what you hear.

Bill and Stu thought the space would be great.  It's a little far from the campus Emergence Operation Center (EOC), but that may be OK for now.  (When the county activates our EOC, the ACS will be able to come in and staff the radio room to augment communications between the EOC and other disaster response partners in the County and beyond.)  It's enough to take the next steps in making the radio room a reality, anyway.  

Preparatory ork includes making sure the space has internet connectivity (ethernet), has enough power outlets (and a circuit that's at least 15 amps), and can be plumbed to allow for cable being run from the inside of the room to antennas that will be mounted on the roof outside the room.  (Hopefully, the campus is not going to be so precious about the appearance of the buildings that it's going to deny a request to mount some antennas!)  Once the space has that infrastructure, we'll call on the talented folks from the [Conejo Valley Amateur Radio Club](http://www.cvarc.org) and ask them to help us set up the shack!  And once the radios are running, we'll start opening the doors to students.
