I was today days old when I learned that you don't have to study for an amateur radio license by yourself.  HamStudy has the capability to invite other people on your preparation journey by sharing with them your study progress.

Here's how you do it.

In the app, click on the profile icon in near the top right of the display.  This opens a sharing screen.

The sharing screen allows you to input the username of others who have shared their progress with you.  You can also input the username of those whom you want to share your progress.

Use this functionality to get support from a Coach like a faculty advisor to the club or another student who has taken and passed the exam.  Or, connect with others who are preparing for an exam with you.  Make it a 'progress contest'!

NOTE:  you'll need to know the HamStudy username of the person you're connecting with to do this.
