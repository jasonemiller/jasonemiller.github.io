Getting Arduino Feather RP2040 RFM96 to work with Arduino IDE on MacOS with the Radiohead libraries.

## STEP 1:  Get the RadioHead libraries

Download the Adafruit fork of the [Radiohead libraries](https://learn.adafruit.com/feather-rp2040-rfm69/using-the-rfm69-radio#radiohead-library-example-2328977).  This library is recommended by Adafruit.

Rename the downloaded, unzipped folder, as `Radiohead`.  Copy the renamed folder to your Arduino 'sketches' folder.  (On MacOS, this would go in `\User\Documents\Arduino\libraries\`.  On a Windows machine, it is in the `Documents` folder in the user's home directory.)

## STEP 2:  Install Board

The following reflects the instructions [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/feather-rp2040-rfm69/arduino-ide-setup).

In the Arduino IDE, go to the Settings selection in the Files menu.  A dialog box ill open up.  At the bottom of the list of items in the box is a field for `Additional board Managers URLs`.  Put the following in that field:

https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-pico/releases/download/global/package_rp2040_index.json

Click `OK` to close the settings window.  In the Arduindo IDE, click on `Tools>Boards>Boards Manager`.  If you've already selected a board in the Board Manager, the name of that board might appear after `Boards` in the menu.

This will open the Boards Manager, a left sidebar in the Arduino IDE window.  Search for RP2040 and select `Raspberry Pi Pico`.  (There might be `/RP2040' ending that item.)  Click the `Install` button to install the board library.

Close the Board Manager, if you like.

In `Tools > Boards`, select the `Raspberry Pi RP2040 Boards` menu item, which will open a submenu; select `Adafruit RP2040 RFM` from the submenu list.

## STEP 3:  There is no step 3.
