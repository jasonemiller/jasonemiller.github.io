In a little over a week, I play host to 33 junior high students from Kansas City who are going to come to <a href="http://www.truman.edu" title="Truman State University homepage" target="_blank">Truman</a>&rsquo;s campus and spend three days learning what college is like. For the last few weeks, I&rsquo;ve been madly putting a program together that leans somehow on model rocketry. What can be more fun that controlled explosions, right?

I'm also going to do some low-altitude ballooning. (Balloons demonstrate another way to overcome the force of gravity.) My approach is based off the ["Helium Balloon Imaging Satellite"](http://makeprojects.com/Project/Balloon-Imaging-Satellite-/307/1) project in _Make Magazine_, volume 24. That project has some hidden pitfalls that I'll share if people are interested. For today, I want to show a picture of a rig I made to overcome a lack of a working helium canister (or regulator). I thought I'd test lofting my payload with a kite.

Normally, I'd get my 9 year-old to help me by holding the kite off the ground while I pulled it into the sky, running upwind. Holding it off the ground is especially important, given that I'll have a payload hanging off the bottom of the kite. Can't just let that drag on the ground. But the family was out of town, and I had to do this solo.

Above is a picture of my rig: it's two 2x4s wedged into my truck's roof rack so they are angled up. The truck is parked facing with the wind so when I pull the string on the kite, the kite will be moving into the wind. The rig worked great, and it would have worked better if there had been a breeze.

The project in Make Magazine has you construct a camera system using a digital still camera.  I made one of these (three, actually), but I thought I'd test my kite-rig with a MinoHD video camera.  In the video I recorded, you can hear the kite zip off my launch rig, and you can watch as it flies across my front yard; you see the chicken tractor, part of the driveway, the front walkway, a garden hose, and when you see the Queen Anne's Lace in the long grass, get ready for the crash.

The test-of-concept was successful, I thought.  It would have worked better if there had been any wind to provide lift.
